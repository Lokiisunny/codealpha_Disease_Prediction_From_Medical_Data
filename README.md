🩺 Disease Prediction from Medical Data using Machine Learning This project aims to predict common diseases — including Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Breast Cancer — using machine learning algorithms trained on synthetic medical data. The dataset simulates realistic features such as symptoms, age, blood test results, and vital signs to build predictive models that aid in early diagnosis.

🔍 Objective The goal is to:

Generate a labeled medical dataset suitable for classification tasks

Train and evaluate various machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Random Forest

XGBoost

Compare model performance based on accuracy and classification metrics

Provide reproducible code for training, evaluation, and model tuning
